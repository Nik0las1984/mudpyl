Features and miscellanea:
 - smarter creation of log files and directories
 - add in some way to profile the client
 - some kind of persistence mechanism?
 - modules to be written:
    - the Big Bad Combat System (ie, an autosipper first off)
    - automapper
    - not to be written, but targetting.py wants multiple targets and target
      switching added.
    - colourtells.py should also colour TELLS and SHOWTELL.
    - colourtells.py should have a SHOWTELLCOLOURS alias
 - write a manual?
    - related but different: manpages
 - MXP? May be too heavyweight to do nicely and keep the core small.
 - rename Metaline.insert to insert_after, and add a new method called 
   insert_before.
 - have something line instance_macro.
 - more convenient (ie, one function) reloading
 - should TriggerMatchingRealm get send_after?

Screen related:
 - search facility in the output
 - a little timer thing to show you how long you've been online for
 - or, even better than pausing: screen splitting
 - something to show you when each line arrived.
 - some way of showing that the screen's paused.

Test related:
 - Tests that need writing:
    - output_manager.py, gui/*gui.py
    - The realms has imperfect test coverage right now
    - TelnetClient has untested parts
    - most stuff under library/
    - LineAlterer needs some
    - the GTK-specific bits of gui/keychords.py
 - Use a proper mocking system instead of ad-hocking a new set of mock objects
   in every test file. This might require writing an interface spec.
 - write a few integration tests

Other refactorings:
 - customisation! Make the split char customisable, make the font 
   customisable; these are only the tip of the iceberg. Echoing toggling?
   Look through the code for hardcoded strings, etc.
 - separate the different layers (MCCP, Telnet, Matching, Output-Managing, 
   Outputs) more cleanly into Protocols, etc; ie, drink some more of the 
   Twisted koolaid.
 - make an abstract GUI interface, allowing for some other implementations 
   besides wx. This is kind of half done informally, but half not.
