gui/gtkgui.py:
 - when the selection extends to the very last character, when more text
   is written to screen, that's added to the selection as well.
    - this may be intentional on PyGTK's part
 - at startup, the text areas aren't filled out for a moment

net/mccp.py:
 - connecting to Achaea, the IAC WILL ECHO comes too late to hide the pw when
   MCCP is on

realms.py:
 - if we close before the connection is opened, self.telnet is None, and this
   is not tested just yet.
