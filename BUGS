metaline.py:
 - _LoopingLast doesn't quite work like expected with slices.

gui/gtkgui.py:
 - when the output window has focus, the command line's cursor doesn't show
 - when the selection extends to the very last character, when more text
   is written to screen, that's added to the selection as well.
