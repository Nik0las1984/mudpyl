gui/wxgui.py:
 - All of these look like they are bugs with wx, not with mudpyl, and fixing
   them is more trouble than it's worth. Recommendation: use the gtkgui.
     - the selection poofs as soon as more text comes in.
     - bug in wx? The emulated key press isn't what we asked for
     - scrolling + pausing doesn't work
     - paused screens still get some jitter
     - selecting something when the screen's paused and more stuff is coming
       in is broken.
     - pausing as a whole doesn't work
 - make the screen fullscreen
 - copying from output window when focus is on command line may or may not be
   broken.

library/html.py:
 - the HTML log breaks on unicode input

metaline.py:
 - _LoopingLast doesn't quite work like expected with slices.
