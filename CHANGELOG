      removal

    - gtkgui.py: now has a counter of how long the session has lasted, and
      whether the screen is paused or not.
    - output_manager.py: now does two more hooks, connection_closed and
      connection_opened.
    - html.py and gtkgui.py: both now show when the session started and ended.
    - gtkgui.py: split into gtkcommandline.py and gtkoutput.py

    - output_manager.py: removed the connection_*, peek_line and close, and
      made them hooks in realms.py. Many other files touched by this, because
      of the renaming and such.
