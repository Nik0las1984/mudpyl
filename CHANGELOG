    - escape_parser.py: Removed the obscure backslash-plus-newline-character
      removal

    - gtkgui.py: now has a counter of how long the session has lasted, and
      whether the screen is paused or not.
    - output_manager.py: now does two more hooks, connection_closed and
      connection_opened.
    - html.py and gtkgui.py: both now show when the session started and ended.
    - gtkgui.py: split into gtkcommandline.py and gtkoutput.py

    - output_manager.py: removed the connection_*, peek_line and close, and
      made them hooks in realms.py. Many other files touched by this, because
      of the renaming and such.
    - realms.py: the macros from mudpyl.gui.bindings are now automatically
      loaded.

    - telnet.py: now treats the MUD's text as a series of bytes and decodes
      it using a given encoding, defaulting to utf-8. TelnetClientFactory now
      takes a second argument to construct, the encoding to use.
    - modules.py: modules now have another attribute, encoding.
    - wxgui.py: removed
    - gtkgui.py and gtkcommandline.py: the tabdict attribute was moved from
      the GUI class to the CommandView class.
    - html.py: now correctly sets the encoding

    - metaline.py: blank_between now fails if it would be blanking the start
      of the list, and index_adjust now normalises the list as well.
