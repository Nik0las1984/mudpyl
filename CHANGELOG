2008-07-24 Sam Pointon <sampointon@gmail.com>
    - realms.py, matchers.py, triggers.py, aliases.py: fixed the order that

    - realms.py: new attribute, baked_in_macros, that populate the macros
      dictionary by default.
    - mudconnect.py: changed the order of initialisation so that the loaded
      module can fiddle around with the macros baked in by the GUI.
    - gui/gtkgui.py, gui/gtkcommandline.py: these now bake in the page up|down
      and copy forwarding to the output window as macros.
    - library/imperian/balance.py: new file; balance highlighter.

2008-03-09 Sam Pointon <sampointon@gmail.com>
    - mudconnect.py: now has an option to profile the client's execution
    - gtkoutput.py: achieve a speedup by a factor of four by caching colour
      tags and inserting in larger chunks
    - output_manager.py: new hook - peek_metaline, which passes the whole
      metaline around after line wrapping

    - metaline.py, gtkoutput.py, colours.py: cache stuff for speedups

      more efficient.

2008-03-24 Sam Pointon <sampointon@gmail.com>

      history line.

2008-01-08  Sam Pointon <sampointon@gmail.com>
    - escape_parser.py: Removed the obscure backslash-plus-newline-character
      removal

2008-01-11 Sam Pointon <sampointon@gmail.com>
    - gtkgui.py: now has a counter of how long the session has lasted, and
      whether the screen is paused or not.
    - output_manager.py: now does two more hooks, connection_closed and
      connection_opened.
    - html.py and gtkgui.py: both now show when the session started and ended.
    - gtkgui.py: split into gtkcommandline.py and gtkoutput.py

2008-01-12 Sam Pointon <sampointon@gmail.com>
    - output_manager.py: removed the connection_*, peek_line and close, and
      made them hooks in realms.py. Many other files touched by this, because
      of the renaming and such.
    - realms.py: the macros from mudpyl.gui.bindings are now automatically
      loaded.

2008-01-15 Sam Pointon <sampointon@gmail.com>
    - telnet.py: now treats the MUD's text as a series of bytes and decodes
      it using a given encoding, defaulting to utf-8. TelnetClientFactory now
      takes a second argument to construct, the encoding to use.
    - modules.py: modules now have another attribute, encoding.
    - wxgui.py: removed
    - gtkgui.py and gtkcommandline.py: the tabdict attribute was moved from
      the GUI class to the CommandView class.
    - html.py: now correctly sets the encoding

2008-01-22 Sam Pointon <sampointon@gmail.com>
    - metaline.py: blank_between now fails if it would be blanking the start
      of the list, and index_adjust now normalises the list as well.

    - library/imperian/autosipper.py: new module.

2008-02-07 Sam Pointon <sampointon@gmail.com>

      about case.
    - gui/gtkoutput.py gui/gtkcommandline.py: make copying from the output
      window work with the command line always having focus

2008-02-08 Sam Pointon <sampointon@gmail.com>

      name of the main module.
