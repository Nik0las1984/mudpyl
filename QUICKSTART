===========================
Getting Started With mudpyl
===========================

mudpyl is a simple MUD client written entirely in Python. It aims to implement
very little in the core of the client, and allow the user to customise it to
a great extent. This means: no in-house scripting languages, no invented
serialisation or storage systems. Just pure Python.

Connecting to a MUD
-------------------

This is nice and simple. Once mudpyl is installed, you will be able to use the
script named ``mudconnect.py`` to load modules and connect to MUDs with a 
minimum of wheel reinvention. This script takes one argument: the name of the 
Python module where the mudpyl module is located. This file will be imported 
and the mudpyl module will be usenged for MUD connection.

An example: imagine that there is a MUD located at foo.org on port 23. We have
a character named Fred on this MUD. In a directory on ``sys.path``, create a 
file named ``fred.py``::

    from mudpyl.modules import BaseModule

    class MainModule(BaseModule):
        name = 'fred'
        host = 'foo.org'
        port = 23

Now, from a command line, execute ``python mudconnect.py fred``. The magic 
should work, and a window should open connecting you to foo.org. This will 
only work if the definition is actually called ``MainModule``: anything else 
won't work.

Personally, I keep all my MUD character profiles in a separate folder, named
``mudworlds``, and keep this under version control. But you can arrange yours
however you want, so long as ``import`` *name* would import your module.

A simple alias
--------------

foo.org is a fast paced game: you can't afford to spend all day typing some
long commands out. This is grunt work! Fortunately, mudpyl allows us to define
aliases as shortcuts for other things. Let's say there's a really irritating,
long command, *reallyirritatinglongcommand*, that we want to mnemonicise 
to *rilc*.

To do this, our previous example script becomes::

    from mudpyl.modules import BaseModule
    from mudpyl.aliases import non_binding_alias

    @non_binding_alias("^rilc$")
    def rilc_mnemonic(match, realm):
        realm.send("reallyirritatinglongcommand")
        realm.send_to_mud = False

    class MainModule(BaseModule):
        name = 'fred'
        host = 'foo.org'
        port = 23
        aliases = [rilc_mnemonic()]

Aliases use regular expressions to know when to fire: here, ours matches on
``/^rilc$/``. They can match multiple times per line, and the body of code
will be called once for each match, so the start and end markers are quite
important.

The core of an alias is just a Python function that's called with some values.
The ``match`` argument is the MatchObject (from the stdlib's re module) for 
this specific match. ``realm`` is the whole context that your code is running
in -- here, an ``AliasMatchingRealm``. This is the main brain of the client:
this is how lines are sent to the MUD, and where all sorts of helpful flags
and data live. We set a flag here: ``send_to_mud`` defines whether the current
line (that the alias matched on) will be sent to the MUD or not. Defaultly,
this is True, but on our MUD *rilc* is nonsense, so we don't send it.

So, now, whenever you enter *rilc* on its own, it won't get sent: instead,
*reallylongirritatingcommand* will.

Macros
------

Let's suppose that this isn't enough. If you had to type out *rilc* then hit
carriage return all day, that'd feel like four characters too many. Isn't 
there some way to cut it down to just one?

There is a system of doing just that, called macros. These bind keys to Python
functions, which are run whenever the key is pressed. This works for keychords
as well (for example, Control-Meta-Q). mudpyl binds a default set of keys to
macros, without any extra work on your part. The keys bound are listed in
``doc/gui.rst``.

To bind F1 and make it send *reallylongirritatingcommand*, our ``fred.py`` 
now looks like this::

    from mudpyl.modules import BaseModule
    from mudpyl.aliases import non_binding_alias
    from mudpyl.gui.keychords import from_string

    @non_binding_alias("^rilc$")
    def rilc_mnemonic(match, realm):
        realm.send("reallyirritatinglongcommand")
        realm.send_to_mud = False

    def rilc_macro(realm):
        realm.send("rilc")

    class MainModule(BaseModule):
        name = 'fred'
        host = 'foo.org'
        port = 23
        aliases = [rilc_mnemonic()]
        macros = {from_string('<F1>'): rilc_macro}

mudpyl uses a special object to represent a keypress. This object can be 
created from a string representation: this is the ``from_string`` function.
Macros are stored in a simple dictionary, where the key is, funnily enough,
the key.

Now when this module is run, whenever F1 is pressed, *rilc* is sent. Note that
this is a macro, sending a line, which fires an alias -- aliases will match
on anything sent, by anything, even themselves. When writing complicated 
aliases, you should be careful of causing infinite loops.

Triggers
--------

Even one keypress is too much. You need to send *reallyirritatinglongcommand*
in the heat of battle, when you need to have reacted three seconds ago. mudpyl
can automatically send a line (or do other things, as well) when the MUD
sends us a line that matches a certain pattern.

If you need to send *reallyirritatinglongcommand* every time you see a line
line "*name* hits you with a large stick.", then the regular expression to
match would be ``/^\w+ hits you with a large stick\.$/``. Again, the ^ and $
are significant, as triggers can fire multiple times on a given line. The 
function is as simple as::

    def rilc_trigger(match, realm):
        realm.send("rilc")

Or, tying this into the running example::

    from mudpyl.modules import BaseModule
    from mudpyl.aliases import non_binding_alias
    from mudpyl.triggers import non_binding_trigger
    from mudpyl.gui.keychords import from_string

    @non_binding_alias("^rilc$")
    def rilc_mnemonic(match, realm):
        realm.send("reallyirritatinglongcommand")
        realm.send_to_mud = False

    @non_binding_trigger("^\w+ hits you with a large stick\.$")
    def rilc_trigger(match, realm):
        realm.send("rilc")

    def rilc_macro(realm):
        realm.send("rilc")

    class MainModule(BaseModule):
        name = 'fred'
        host = 'foo.org'
        port = 23
        aliases = [rilc_mnemonic()]
        triggers = [rilc_trigger()]
        macros = {from_string('<F1>'): rilc_macro}

The decorated function needs to be called to actually create an instance of it:
the object bound to ``rilc_trigger`` is actually a class, not an individual 
trigger. The same applies to ``rilc_alias``.

Conclusion
----------

There you go, a whirlwind tour of the basic use of mudpyl. For other, more
detailed documentation, see the files under ``doc/``, or just read the source
to see what stuff does. The modules under ``library/`` may be particularly
helpful for examples of how to do things.
