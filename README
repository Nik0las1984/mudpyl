What mudpyl is
==============

mudpyl is a pure Python implementation of a MUD client. The aim is to keep the
core concepts simple, and give the user the ability to fiddle around with it
to suit their needs. Therefore, the core of the client is fairly small and
modular, with simple interfaces between the parts.

Briefly, the more interesting features are:

    * Regular-expression based triggers and aliases
    * Trigger-based and fairly safe line rewriting
    * Macros for almost any keys on the keyboard (including with modifiers)
    * Execute Python in-client
    * Coloured HTML logs
    * Supports MCCP v2
    * Tab-completion based on words already seen
    * Keeps a history of previous commands sent
    * NO strange punctuation-based let's-reinvent-the-wheel programming 
      language included!

Installing mudpyl
=================

Decompress and untar the package file, and from the unpacked directory, run::

    python setup.py install

Or, from a shell with ``easy_install`` visible::

    easy_install mudpyl

PyGTK is needed by the gtkgui, which is currently the only GUI avabilable;
Twisted, ordereddict and argparse are also needed. peak.util.extremes is 
required by an optional module.

**NOTE**: mudpyl requires python 2.6. This is because it uses a new feature 
in the stdlib module textwrap. 2.5 installations could, in theory at least, 
use the textwrap.py file from trunk.

Running mudpyl
==============

See the file QUICKSTART for a tutorial-style guide for connecting to a MUD.
