What mudpyl is
==============

mudpyl is a pure Python implementation of a MUD client. The aim is to keep the
core concepts simple, and give the user the ability to fiddle around with it
to suit there needs. Therefore, the core of the client is fairly small and
modular, with simple interfaces between the parts.

Briefly, the more interesting features are:

    * Regular-expression based triggers and aliases
    * Trigger-based and fairly safe line rewriting
    * Macros for almost any keys on the keyboard (including with modifiers)
    * Execute Python in-client
    * Coloured HTML logs
    * Supports MCCP v2
    * Tab-completion based on words already seen
    * Keeps a history of previous commands sent
    * NO strange punctuation-based let's-reinvent-the-wheel programming 
      language included!

Installing mudpyl
=================

Decompress and untar the package file, and from the unpacked directory, run::

    python setup.py install

Or, from a shell with ``easy_install`` visible::

    easy_install mudpyl

Twisted and argparse must be installed. wax and wxpython are required by the 
wxgui; PyGTK is needed by the gtkgui (the default and recommended). 
peak.util.extremes is required by an optional module.

**NOTE**: mudpyl requires python 2.6 (grab it from the trunk, or an alpha when
one is released). This is because it uses a new feature in the stdlib module
textwrap. 2.5 installations could, in theory at least, use the textwrap.py
file from trunk.

Running mudpyl
==============

See the file QUICKSTART for a tutorial-style guide for connecting to a MUD.
